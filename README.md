Long Now Seminar Viewer
=======================

This program is meant to view seminars of the Long Now Foundation in Kodi. 
You need to have an account at https://longnow.org to make use of that plugin.
Please enter your username and password of that website in the settings dialog of
this plugin.

Note: This is not an official plugin of the Long Now Foundation, but my
private project, so please don't bother them if anything breaks.
This might easily be the case, as there is no official interface other than the human-readable website 
at longnow.org that provides access to the seminar videos. Or at least none, that I know of.

Therefore this plugin uses heuristics to parse the website and find the links to the videos. 
This mechanism might break if the structure or the layout of the website changes.
